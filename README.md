AUC integration game
====================

This AUC integration game is an adapted version of the open source game Neverwell Moor. This game was made for the Games & Learning course at Amsterdam University College.

The game we designed is aimed at new AUC students to help them get to know Science Park before they arrive in Amsterdam and to teach them a bit about Dutch culture. Normally, one could use Google maps to ‘walk around’ an area and to get to know an unfamiliar place before arriving there. This is a rather passive and boring way to discover a new place online and trough Google maps you will not learn anything about the culture of the place you are going to. The game enables players to walk around a virtual Science Park, and in that way, help them become familiar with their new environment. Furthermore, through the tasks the players have to perform and through game characters the players learn some things about Dutch language, culture and society. The following information is about the Neverwell Moor game on which our game is based.

Game Information
----------------

Rachel is 15 years old. She grew up hearing stories of a strange island called
"Neverwell", told by her grandfather ("Poppa" to Rachel). Rachel was 5 at the
time, and the stories were always something adventurous and entertaining. Papa
would tell her about the inhabitants of the island, and how they could perform
magic. He would fight monsters while hunting for treasures buried in deep caves.
There were so many details in his stories that he had to set some of his
adventures on smaller islands around Neverwell.

Papa died shortly after, and it's been 10 years, so she doesn't remember all of
the stories he told. But she remembers important details like the eponymous
moor, which was a very dangerous place, but that it held some kind of secret...
Perhaps the secret to the inhabitants magic? But that was a long time ago, and
they were just stories. Everyone knows there is only one island, and they call
it "Earth."

So Rachel sets off on a day like any other, but, feeling a little adventurous,
she decides to help a friend. That kind gesture leads to a series of quests
which eventually lands Rachel on Neverwell; a place that isn't supposed to
exist...
